# Understanding Large Numbers and Rounding

## 1. Reading, Writing, Ordering, and Comparing Numbers up to 10,000,000

### Explanation:
Numbers up to 10,000,000 (ten million) can be read, written, and compared by understanding place values. The place values are:

- Millions (1,000,000)
- Hundred Thousands (100,000)
- Ten Thousands (10,000)
- Thousands (1,000)
- Hundreds (100)
- Tens (10)
- Ones (1)

### Example:
Consider the number **5,748,362**:
- **5** million
- **748** thousand
- **362** units

#### Ordering Numbers:
To compare numbers, look at the digits from left to right, comparing place values one by one.

Example:
Compare 6,520,431 and 6,519,982.
- Compare millions: both are 6,000,000 (equal).
- Compare hundred thousands: both are 500,000 (equal).
- Compare ten thousands: first number has 20,000, second has 19,000 → **6,520,431 is greater.**

#### Practice Problems:
1. Write the following in words:
   - 3,902,156
   - 7,045,289
   - 2,345,678
   - 6,719,482
2. Order these numbers from smallest to largest:
   - 4,872,999; 4,871,765; 4,873,100; 4,870,890; 4,879,000
3. Compare using >, <, or =:
   - 5,678,210 __ 5,678,120
   - 9,003,456 __ 9,100,345
   - 7,832,491 __ 7,832,490
   - 6,502,399 __ 6,502,400
4. Identify the largest and smallest numbers:
   - 2,345,678; 2,987,654; 2,123,456; 2,876,543; 2,890,345; 2,111,222
5. Write the following numbers in standard form:
   - Three million, two hundred forty-five thousand, one hundred twelve
   - Six million, seventy-two thousand, eight hundred one
   - Four million, five hundred sixty-seven thousand, ninety
   - Eight million, nine hundred thousand, two hundred

## 2. Determining the Value of Each Digit

### Explanation:
Each digit in a number has a specific place value based on its position.

### Example:
In the number **8,394,215**:
- 8 is in the millions place → **8,000,000**
- 3 is in the hundred thousands place → **300,000**
- 9 is in the ten thousands place → **90,000**
- 4 is in the thousands place → **4,000**
- 2 is in the hundreds place → **200**
- 1 is in the tens place → **10**
- 5 is in the ones place → **5**

#### Practice Problems:
1. Identify the value of 6 in the number 6,528,391.
2. What is the place value of 9 in 7,981,204?
3. Write each digit's value in the number 3,057,689.
4. Find the sum of the place values of 7 and 3 in 7,362,415.
5. Identify the missing digit if a number is 4,?65,372 and its missing digit is in the hundred thousands place.
6. What is the value of 5 in 5,624,831?
7. Find the total sum of the place values of all digits in 2,345,678.
8. What is the place value of 8 in 8,193,746?
9. Express each digit's place value in 9,248,375.
10. What is the difference between the place values of 4 in 4,532,418?

## 3. Rounding Whole Numbers

### Explanation:
Rounding means adjusting a number to a nearby value based on place value.
- If the digit to the right of the rounding place is **5 or more**, round **up**.
- If the digit to the right is **4 or less**, round **down**.

### Example:
Round **4,678,129** to:
- The nearest million → 5,000,000
- The nearest hundred thousand → 4,700,000
- The nearest ten thousand → 4,680,000
- The nearest thousand → 4,678,000

#### Practice Problems:
1. Round 9,582,341 to the nearest million.
2. Round 4,329,876 to the nearest hundred thousand.
3. Round 7,865,432 to the nearest ten thousand.
4. Round 3,405,678 to the nearest thousand.
5. Round 5,678,912 to the nearest hundred thousand and then to the nearest million.
6. Find the difference between the actual number 8,431,927 and its rounded value to the nearest million.
7. A number rounded to the nearest hundred thousand is 6,500,000. List two possible actual numbers.
8. Round 2,937,584 to the nearest million.
9. Estimate 4,876,214 to the nearest ten thousand.
10. Round 6,589,321 to the nearest hundred thousand and compare it with its nearest million rounding.

## 4. Solving Practical Problems

### Explanation:
Understanding these concepts helps in real-world situations such as estimating population counts, distances, and financial calculations.

### Example:
A city has a population of **7,392,458** people.
- Estimate the population to the nearest million → **7,000,000**
- Estimate to the nearest hundred thousand → **7,400,000**

#### Practice Problems:
1. A company made $5,768,129 in revenue. Estimate to the nearest million.
2. A road is 9,432,756 meters long. Estimate to the nearest hundred thousand.
3. A stadium can hold 4,573,892 people. How many people can it hold rounded to the nearest ten thousand?
4. A city recorded a population of 3,847,209 in 2020. Predict its population in 2025 if it increases by about 150,000 annually.
5. A factory produces 2,648,739 items per year. Estimate its total production over 5 years.
6. An athlete runs approximately 8,756,345 meters per year. Round this to the nearest hundred thousand and estimate their distance over a decade.
7. A school has 1,329,876 books. Estimate the number of books rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
8. A country’s population is approximately 12,678,429. Estimate it to the nearest million.
9. An airport serves 3,456,892 passengers annually. Predict the number of passengers in 3 years if the count increases by 200,000 annually.
10. A warehouse stores 7,938,215 products. If it increases by 500,000 per year, estimate the total in 4 years.
