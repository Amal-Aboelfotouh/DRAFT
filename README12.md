## **1. Understanding Statistics**
Statistics is the study of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting numerical data. It helps in making informed decisions.

### **Types of Data**
- **Qualitative Data**: Descriptive data (e.g., colors, names, labels).
- **Quantitative Data**: Numerical data (e.g., heights, weights, scores).
  - **Discrete Data**: Countable values (e.g., number of students).
  - **Continuous Data**: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight).

### **Measures of Central Tendency**
1. **Mean (Average)**  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum \text{All Values}}{\text{Total Number of Values}}
   \]
   
   **Example**: Find the mean of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25.  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25}{5} = \frac{75}{5} = 15
   \]

2. **Median (Middle Value)**  
   - Arrange the values in ascending order.
   - If odd number of values, median is the middle number.
   - If even number of values, median is the average of two middle numbers.

   **Example**: Find the median of 3, 8, 7, 10, 2.  
   - Sorted: **2, 3, 7, 8, 10** â†’ **Median = 7**
   
   **Example**: Find the median of 6, 9, 3, 12, 15, 18.  
   - Sorted: **3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18**  
   - Middle values: **9, 12**  
   - Median = **(9+12)/2 = 10.5**

3. **Mode (Most Frequent Value)**  
   - The value that appears most frequently.

   **Example**: Find the mode of 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 9.  
   - Mode = **6** (appears most often)

---

## **2. Probability Basics**
Probability measures how likely an event is to happen. It ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}}
\]

### **Example 1: Rolling a Dice**
A standard dice has 6 faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

- Probability of rolling a **3**:
  \[
  P(3) = \frac{1}{6}
  \]
- Probability of rolling an **even number (2, 4, 6)**:
  \[
  P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]

### **Example 2: Drawing a Card**
A standard deck has **52** cards.

- Probability of drawing a **heart**:
  \[
  P(\text{heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
- Probability of drawing a **king**:
  \[
  P(\text{king}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}
  \]

## **3. Data Representation**
### **Pictogram Example**
A survey shows students' favorite sports:

| Sport      | ðŸ˜Š (Each = 5 students) | Total Students |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Soccer     | ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š | 25 |
| Basketball | ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š | 20 |
| Tennis     | ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š | 15 |
| Cricket    | ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š | 10 |

#### **Question: How many students prefer either Soccer or Tennis?**
- Soccer: **25 students**
- Tennis: **15 students**
- **Total = 25 + 15 = 40 students**

---

### **Bar Chart Example**
| Day   | Students Late |
|-------|--------------|
| Monday  | 5 |
| Tuesday | 8 |
| Wednesday | 4 |
| Thursday | 6 |
| Friday | 3 |

#### **Question: What is the average number of late students per day?**
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{5+8+4+6+3}{5} = \frac{26}{5} = 5.2
\]
**Answer: 5.2 students per day (rounded to 5).**

---

## **4. Probability Questions**
### **Example 1: Coin Toss**
A coin has two sides: **Heads (H)** and **Tails (T)**.

**Q1:** What is the probability of getting heads?
\[
P(H) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

**Q2:** What is the probability of getting two heads in a row?
\[
P(HH) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

---

### **Example 2: Two Dice Sum**
If two dice are rolled, find the probability that the sum is **7**.

Possible sums:
- (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) â†’ **6 outcomes**
- Total outcomes: \(6 \times 6 = 36\)

\[
P(\text{sum} = 7) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

---

### **Example 3: Drawing a Marble**
A bag contains **5 red, 4 blue, and 3 green marbles**.

**Q1:** Probability of picking a red marble?
\[
P(\text{red}) = \frac{5}{12}
\]

**Q2:** Probability of NOT picking a red marble?
\[
P(\text{not red}) = 1 - P(\text{red}) = 1 - \frac{5}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
\]

---

## **5. Practice Problems**
### **Statistics:**
1. Find the **mean, median, and mode** for the set: **4, 7, 2, 7, 5, 9, 7**.
2. The scores of students in a test: **50, 60, 70, 80, 90**. Find the mean score.

### **Probability:**
1. A bag has **10 balls**: **4 red, 3 blue, and 3 green**. What is the probability of picking:
   - (a) A blue ball?
   - (b) Not a green ball?
2. If a spinner has **8 sections numbered 1 to 8**, what is the probability of landing on:
   - (a) An even number?
   - (b) A prime number?

- **Probability** measures the likelihood of events happening.
- **Data Handling** involves visualizing data using charts and tables.

# Time Measurement Concepts and Examples

## 1. Identify the Units of Time
- **Basic Units:** Second, Minute, Hour, Day, Month, Year
- **Larger Units:** Decade (10 years), Century (100 years), Millennium (1000 years)

### Examples:
- A school period lasts **40 minutes**.
- A baby is usually born after **9 months** of pregnancy.
- The Great Pyramid of Giza is over **45 centuries** old.

---

## 2. Identify a Leap Year
- A leap year occurs every **4 years**.
- It has **366 days** instead of 365, with February 29 as the extra day.
- A year is a leap year if it is **divisible by 4**.
- However, if it is **divisible by 100**, it must also be **divisible by 400** to be a leap year.

### Examples:
- **2020** was a leap year because it is divisible by 4.
- **1900** was not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
- **2000** was a leap year because it is divisible by 400.

---

## 3. State the Relationships Between Units of Time
- **1 minute = 60 seconds**
- **1 hour = 60 minutes**
- **1 day = 24 hours**
- **1 week = 7 days**
- **1 month = 28 to 31 days**
- **1 year = 12 months**
- **1 decade = 10 years**
- **1 century = 100 years**
- **1 millennium = 1000 years**

### Example Conversions:
- **3 hours = 180 minutes** (3 Ã— 60)
- **2 days = 48 hours** (2 Ã— 24)

---

## 4. Convert Units Used to Measure Time
### Examples:
- Convert **3 days** to hours: 
  - **3 Ã— 24 = 72 hours**
- Convert **90 minutes** to hours:
  - **90 Ã· 60 = 1.5 hours**
- Convert **2 years** to months:
  - **2 Ã— 12 = 24 months**

---

## 5. Add and Subtract Time Given in Different Units
### Examples:
- Add **2 hours and 45 minutes** to **1 hour and 30 minutes**:
  - **(2 + 1) hours = 3 hours**
  - **(45 + 30) minutes = 75 minutes**
  - **75 minutes = 1 hour and 15 minutes**, so total is **4 hours and 15 minutes**.

- Subtract **3 years and 8 months** from **5 years and 2 months**:
  - Convert to months: **(5 Ã— 12 + 2) = 62 months**, **(3 Ã— 12 + 8) = 44 months**
  - **62 - 44 = 18 months** = **1 year and 6 months**

---

## 6. Add and Subtract Time Given in Terms of Months and Years
### Examples:
- Add **5 years and 7 months** to **3 years and 9 months**:
  - **(5 + 3) years = 8 years**
  - **(7 + 9) months = 16 months**
  - **16 months = 1 year and 4 months**, so total is **9 years and 4 months**.

- Subtract **2 years and 5 months** from **6 years and 3 months**:
  - Convert to months: **(6 Ã— 12 + 3) = 75 months**, **(2 Ã— 12 + 5) = 29 months**
  - **75 - 29 = 46 months** = **3 years and 10 months**

---

### Decimals and Fractions
6. Convert **0.125** to a fraction.
   - **Solution:** \( 0.125 = \frac{125}{1000} = \frac{1}{8} \).
7. Convert **0.75** to a fraction.
   - **Solution:** \( 0.75 = \frac{75}{100} = \frac{3}{4} \).
8. Multiply **0.2 Ã— 0.5**.
   - **Solution:** \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \).
9. Divide **0.6 Ã· 3**.
   - **Solution:** \( 0.6 \div 3 = 0.2 \).
10. Convert **0.2** to a fraction.
    - **Solution:** \( 0.2 = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \).
