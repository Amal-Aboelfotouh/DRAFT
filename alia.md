# Understanding Large Numbers and Rounding

## 1. Reading, Writing, Ordering, and Comparing Numbers up to 1,000,000

### Explanation:
Numbers up to 1,000,000 (one million) can be read, written, and compared by understanding place values. The place values are:

- Millions (1,000,000)
- Hundred Thousands (100,000)
- Ten Thousands (10,000)
- Thousands (1,000)
- Hundreds (100)
- Tens (10)
- Ones (1)

### Example:
Consider the number **748,362**:
- **748** thousand
- **362** units

#### Ordering Numbers:
To compare numbers, look at the digits from left to right, comparing place values one by one.

Example:
Compare 520,431 and 519,982.
- Compare hundred thousands: both are 500,000 (equal).
- Compare ten thousands: first number has 20,000, second has 19,000 → **520,431 is greater.**

#### Practice Problems:
1. Write the following in words:
   - 902,156
   - 745,289
   - 345,678
   - 719,482
2. Order these numbers from smallest to largest:
   - 872,999; 871,765; 873,100; 870,890; 879,000
3. Compare using >, <, or =:
   - 678,210 __ 678,120
   - 903,456 __ 910,345
   - 832,491 __ 832,490
   - 502,399 __ 502,400
4. Identify the largest and smallest numbers:
   - 345,678; 987,654; 123,456; 876,543; 890,345; 111,222
5. Write the following numbers in standard form:
   - Three hundred forty-five thousand, one hundred twelve
   - Six hundred seventy-two thousand, eight hundred one
   - Four hundred sixty-seven thousand, ninety
   - Eight hundred ninety thousand, two hundred

## 2. Counting Forwards and Backwards in Powers of 10

### Explanation:
Counting in steps of powers of ten means increasing or decreasing by factors of ten, hundred, thousand, etc.

### Example:
Start at 245,000 and count forward and backward by:
- 10,000: 255,000 → 265,000 → 275,000...
- 100,000: 345,000 → 445,000 → 545,000...
- 1,000: 246,000 → 247,000 → 248,000...

#### Practice Problems:
1. Count forward from 230,000 by 10,000 up to 300,000.
2. Count backward from 450,000 by 50,000 down to 200,000.
3. Fill in the missing numbers:
   - 640,000 → ___ → 660,000 → ___ → 680,000
   - 875,000 → ___ → 855,000 → ___ → 835,000
4. Start at 123,456 and count forward by 1,000 up to 135,456.
5. Start at 890,000 and count backward by 100,000 down to 400,000.

## 3. Interpreting Negative Numbers

### Explanation:
Negative numbers appear in real-life contexts like temperature, debt, and altitude. When counting with negatives, we go below zero and back up.

### Example:
A temperature of -5°C rises by 7°C. New temperature = -5 + 7 = **2°C**.

#### Practice Problems:
1. Count from -10 to 10.
2. Fill in the missing numbers:
   - -20, ___, -10, ___, 0, ___, 10
   - 15, ___, 5, ___, -5, ___, -15
3. A submarine is at -400m depth. It rises 150m. What is its new depth?
4. A temperature is -8°C. It drops by 5°C. What is the new temperature?
5. A debt of -$2,500 is paid with $1,500. What is the new balance?

## 4. Rounding Whole Numbers to the Nearest 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000

### Explanation:
- Look at the digit to the right of the rounding place.
- If it's 5 or more, round up.
- If it's 4 or less, round down.

### Example:
Round **678,129** to:
- The nearest ten → 678,130
- The nearest hundred → 678,100
- The nearest thousand → 678,000
- The nearest ten thousand → 680,000
- The nearest hundred thousand → 700,000

#### Practice Problems:
1. Round 582,341 to the nearest hundred.
2. Round 329,876 to the nearest thousand.
3. Round 865,432 to the nearest ten thousand.
4. Round 405,678 to the nearest hundred thousand.
5. Find the difference between 431,927 and its rounded value to the nearest ten thousand.
6. A number rounded to the nearest thousand is 350,000. List two possible actual numbers.
7. Round 237,584 to the nearest hundred thousand.
8. Estimate 876,214 to the nearest ten thousand.
9. Round 689,321 to the nearest hundred and compare it with rounding to the nearest thousand.

## 5. Solving Practical Problems

### Explanation:
Understanding numbers helps in estimating population counts, financial calculations, and measurements.

### Example:
A city has a population of **392,458**.
- Nearest hundred thousand → **400,000**
- Nearest ten thousand → **390,000**

#### Practice Problems:
1. A company made $768,129 in revenue. Estimate to the nearest hundred thousand.
2. A road is 432,756 meters long. Estimate to the nearest ten thousand.
3. A stadium can hold 573,892 people. Round to the nearest thousand.
4. A city recorded a population of 347,209 in 2020. Predict its population in 2025 if it increases by 15,000 annually.
5. A factory produces 248,739 items per year. Estimate total production over 5 years.
6. A school has 329,876 books. Round to the nearest hundred thousand.
7. An airport serves 456,892 passengers annually. Predict the total in 3 years if it increases by 20,000 annually.
8. A warehouse stores 938,215 products. If it increases by 50,000 per year, estimate the total in 4 years.
9. A teacher grades 1,450 papers each month. Estimate the total graded in a year.
10. A farmer harvests 875,000 kg of wheat annually. Estimate the total over 6 years if production increases by 25,000 kg yearly.
