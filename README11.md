# Mathematical Concepts and Examples

## 1. Order of Operations (BODMAS)
### Example:
```
8 + 2 × 5 = 8 + 10 = 18 (Multiplication first)
(8 + 2) × 5 = 10 × 5 = 50 (Parentheses first)
```

## 2. Squares, Cubes, and Roots
### Example:
```
Square of 4: 4² = 16
Cube of 3: 3³ = 27
Square root of 25: √25 = 5
Cube root of 27: ³√27 = 3
```

## 3. Decimal and Fraction Conversions
### Example:
```
Convert 1/4 to decimal: 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25
Convert 0.75 to fraction: 0.75 = 3/4
```

## 4. Multiplication and Division by Powers of 10
### Example:
```
0.45 × 10 = 4.5
5.67 ÷ 100 = 0.0567
```

## 5. Linear Equations
### Example:
```
Solve 3x + 5 = 14
3x = 14 - 5
3x = 9
x = 9 ÷ 3
x = 3
```

## 6. Ratios and Proportions
### Example:
```
Express 8:12 as a simplified ratio: 8:12 = 2:3
Find k in y = kx when y = 10 and x = 2:
10 = k × 2 ⟹ k = 5
```

## 7. Percentage Calculations
### Example:
```
Find 20% of 50: (20/100) × 50 = 10
Increase 100 by 30%: 100 + (30% of 100) = 130
```

## 8. Graph Interpretation
### Example:
```
For a speed-time graph, the area under the curve represents distance traveled.
```

## 9. Statistics Measures
### Example:
```
Mode: Most frequent number in {2, 3, 3, 5, 7} is 3
Median: Middle value in {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} is 5
Mean: (2+4+6+8)/4 = 5
Range: 9 - 2 = 7
```

## 10. Trigonometry and Geometry
### Example:
```
Find the missing side using Pythagoras' theorem:
If a = 3, b = 4, c = ?, then c² = 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 ⟹ c = 5
```

## 11. Area Calculations
### Example:
```
Area of Rectangle: length × width = 5 × 3 = 15 square units
```

## 12. Slope and Linear Equations
### Example:
```
Slope formula: m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)
Equation of a line: y = mx + b
```

## 13. Quadratic Functions
### Example:
```
y = x² - 4x + 3 ⟹ Vertex at (2, -1), minimum value = -1
```

## 14. Exponential Growth and Decay
### Example:
```
Exponential function: A = P(1 + r)^t
```

## 15. Triangle Theorems
### Example:
```
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°
SOH CAH TOA: sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse
```
